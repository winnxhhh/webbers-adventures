# WEBBER'S ADVENTURES

Welcome to Webber's Adventures, a fun and simple platform game! I made this in Apr 2023 for my module's final project, and it was my first coding project ever- I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I did making it :D

To launch the game:
1. open the code in VSCode or any of your preferred IDE
2. open the code in LIVE PREVIEW
3. copy the URL generated in the live preview and paste in your desired browser (google chrome or mozilla firefox is recommended)
4. enjoy!
